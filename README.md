# DataStructures.JS
This project is aimed to implement the different dataStructures learned in a CS curriculum using the modern programming language "JavaScript" .
The aim is to provide a simple concise and usable implementation of these data structures providing all different algorithms and some examples of problems solved using these implementations .

## Hash Tables : 
### intro 
Hash Tables are very important data structures in computer science , proof to this , they are usally implemented natively in a programming language or can be easily found in default language packages , they come in different names : assossiative arrays(php) ,objects(js) , HashMap(Java) , Dictionnary(C#) ... The goal of creating them is to be able to perform the common operations like inserting , updating , searching , deleting items in a constant run-time ( complexity of O(1) ) , and thats by MAPPING keys to values using a hash function
### implementation in DataStructures.JS
You can find the implementation in javascript of 3 different collision solving methods in the file hashTables.js
